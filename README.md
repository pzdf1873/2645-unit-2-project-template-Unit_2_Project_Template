# ELEC2645 Unit 2 Project - ALU Simulation (working with binary numbers)




This is a command line interface project that allows a user to do multiple tasks with a binary number. This includes Binary Arithmetic Operations, Logical Operations, and Binary Conversion. 

The code has separated the menu handling code in `main.c` and the function implementations in `funcs.c`. There have been updates to both funcs.c and main.c. Most of the new and important functions have been declared in funcs.c however there are also some new useful functions in main.c.


### 1 Binary Arithmetic

The user is given 3 options. Option 1 will allow the user to enter 2 binary numbers that they would like to add together. Option 2 will allow the user to enter 2 binary numbers that they want to subtract. Option 3 will allow the user to enter 2 numbers that they want to multiply together. 


### 2 Logical Operations

The user has the options to either carry out a logical AND, OR and NOT function. The AND & OR functions ask the user for 2 binary inputs whereas the NOT function will ask for 1.



### 3 Binary Conversion

Finally, the user will be able to enter a binary number and it will be converted to denary or hexadecimal based off of the input that they have chosen.
